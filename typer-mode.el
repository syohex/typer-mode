;;; Commentary:
;; Provides a program to practise your keyboard typing. It provides a
;; buffer with text that need be typed. As the user starts typing the
;; correct characters, they get removed from the buffer. If the user
;; types the wrong character a new line of text is added. This goes on
;; until the user types all characters correct which results in "Game Won".
;; If the user makes to many succesive errors then it’s "Game Over".
